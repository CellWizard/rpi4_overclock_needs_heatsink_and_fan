# rpi4_overclock_needs_heatsink_and_fan
Raspberry Pi 4 super overvolting and overclocking source code.  With Peltier cooling it may work up to 3.1GHz.  There is a possibility of the Pi 4 burning up if not cooled properly or if voltage is set too high.  8GB RAM draws too much current from PMIC so overvolting works better on 4GB and 2GB models.
